<h1>The best movies from Disney</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 for when you are at home</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Lilo & Stitch</h3>
 <p>This is the number 1 because, personally it's my favorite, and also I considered it's an amazing film to distract yourself from all the stress of the day</p>
 <h3>Toy Story (all 3 movies)</h3>
 <p>Amazing films, cleavers with a touch of humor and a little bit of drama</p>
 <h3>Moana</h3>
 <p>As Lilo & Stitch, I considered this movie to be into the top three because of the history, and the proximity to a different culture, along with a beautiful story</p>
